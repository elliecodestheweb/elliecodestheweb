### Hi there 👋 I'm Ellie (she/her)!
I'm a San Diego based front end web developer and web content producer. I currently work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive development. I hope to continue my learning and dive into React soon! I'm a career changer, so I was self-directed in my learning for a few years. I love to share resources and articles for new developers, so feel free to reach out if you ever want to know how to get started! I was also a student of San Diego Workforce Partnership & UCSD Extension's Income Share Agreement program and graduated in December 2020. This program gave me the opportunity to make a career change, and I couldn't be happier! As someone with a non-traditional tech background, I am still learning so much every day and want to get better at what I do.

## Details:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a tracker application to help me catalog and track my tarot & oracle deck collection.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with advice on the best approach to build my project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Visual Design and a little SEO.
- 💬 Ask me about resources on how to get started learning development! I'm always happy to help!
