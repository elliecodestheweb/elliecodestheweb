### Hi there 👋 I'm Ellie (she/her)!
I'm a San Diego based front end web developer and nap enthusiast. I'm currently a web content designer working on my front end skills. I pretty much work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and making websites responsive. I hope to continue my learning and dive into React or some web design. I was self-directed in my learning for a few years, so I love to share resources and articles for new developers! I was also a student of San Diego Workforce Partnership & UCSD Extension's Income Share Agreement program and just graduated in December 2020. 

As someone with a non-traditional tech background, I am still learning so much every day and want to get better at what I do. 🌱

## Random Facts:
- ✨ I love all things Disney and would live at Disneyland if I could. 🏰
- ✨ I buy too many Udemy courses that I never complete. 📚
- ✨ I own more nail polish than I could possibly use. 💅
- ✨ I'm a synesthete - I have chromesthesia! 🎶🌈
