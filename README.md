### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ellie (she/her)!
I'm a San Diego based front end web developer and nap enthusiast. I'm currently a web content designer. I was also a student of San Diego Workforce Partnership & UCSD Extension's Income Share Agreement program and just graduated in December 2020. I would love to connect with others to both learn from and be a resource to the community!

## Random Facts:
- âœ¨ I love all things Disney! 
- âœ¨ I'm currently working as a Web Content Designer.
- âœ¨ I own more nail polish than I could possibly use but I LOVE IT.
- âœ¨ Fun fact: I'm a synesthete! I have chomesthesia and experience sounds as color.
