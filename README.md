### Hi there 👋 I'm Ellie (she/her)!
I'm a front end web developer from San Diego. I'm currently a student of San Diego Workforce Partnership & UCSD Extension's Income Share Agreement program pilot cohort. I'm transitioning my career into tech, and would love to connect with others to both learn from and be a resource to the community.

## Random Facts:
- ✨ I love all things Disney! 
- ✨ I'm currently learning Content Management Systems & WordPress.
- ✨ I own more nail polish than I could possibly use, but I LOVE IT.
- ✨ Fun fact: I'm a synesthete! I have chomesthesia and experience sounds as color.
